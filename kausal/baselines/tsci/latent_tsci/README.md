The code in this folder is meant to reproduce experiments with the combination of latent CCM and TSCI. They are reliant on the [latent CCM code](https://github.com/edebrouwer/latentCCM/tree/master), available under an MIT license. The changes in `latentccm` allow for returning the derivatives used by the GRU-ODE cells, and `experiments/Dpendulum` is modified to use this data and run latent TSCI.

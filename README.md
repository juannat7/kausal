# Abstract
We use a deep Koopman operator-theoretic formalism to develop a novel causal discovery algorithm, Kausal. Causal discovery aims to identify cause-effect mechanisms for better scientific understanding, explainable decision-making, and more accurate modeling. Standard statistical frameworks, such as Granger causality, lack the ability to quantify causal relationships in nonlinear dynamics due to the presence of complex feedback mechanisms, timescale mixing, and nonstationarity. This presents a challenge in studying many real-world systems, such as the Earth's climate. Meanwhile, Koopman operator methods have emerged as a promising tool for approximating nonlinear dynamics in a linear space of observables. In Kausal, we propose to leverage this powerful idea for causal analysis where optimal observables are inferred using deep learning. Causal estimates are then evaluated in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and defined as the distance between the marginal dynamics of the effect and the joint dynamics of the cause-effect observables. Our numerical experiments demonstrate Kausal's superior ability in discovering and characterizing causal signals compared to existing approaches of prescribed observables. Lastly, we extend our analysis to observations of El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation highlighting our algorithm's applicability to real-world phenomena. 

# Installation
> __NOTE__: Since the package is still under review and in active development, we recommend cloning the repository for an early view. Published work will provide an easy installation through `PyPi` hosting, for example.

```
git clone https://github.com/juannat7/kausal.git
```

# Quickstart Guide
> __NOTE__: Please refer to our example notebooks (in `examples/`) for demonstration!


`Kausal` provides an interface to perform causal analysis based on Koopman operator theory, between two set of multivariate timeseries:

```python
import torch
from kausal import koopman

# Define your cause/effect variables
cause = torch.tensor(...)  # Shape (n_features, *, n_timestep)
effect = torch.tensor(...) # Shape (n_features, *, n_timestep)

# Initialize `Kausal` object
model = koopman.Kausal(
    cause = cause,
    effect = effect
)

# Estimate causal effect
causal_effect = model.evaluate(
    time_shift = 1
)
```

You can also specify specific observable functions, e.g., `MLP` or `CNN`.
```python
from kausal.observables import MLPFeatures

model = koopman.Kausal(
    marginal_observable = MLPFeatures(...),
    joint_observable = MLPFeatures(...),
    cause = ...,
    effect = ...
)
```

Several regression techniques to estimate the Koopman operator is also provided, e.g., pseudo-inverse (`PINV`) or low-rank dynamic mode decomposition (`DMD`).
```python
from kausal.regressors import DMD

model = koopman.Kausal(
    regressor = DMD(svd_rank = 4),
    cause = ...,
    effect = ...
)
```
